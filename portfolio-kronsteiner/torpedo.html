                <ol>
                    <li> <span class="bold"> Disorganized Packing Process: </span>Many individuals struggle with organizing
                        their belongings and creating packing lists when preparing for an international move. Without a
                        structured approach, they may overlook essential items or become overwhelmed by the task.
                    </li>
                    <li> <span class="bold"> Document Management Challenges: </span>Managing important documents such as
                        passports, visas, residency permits, and medical records can be cumbersome and stressful during the
                        relocation process. Users may face difficulties in keeping track of various documents and ensuring their
                        accessibility when needed.

                    <li> <span class="bold"> Lack of Local Information: </span>Relocating to a new city or country often entails
                        unfamiliarity with local customs, regulations, services, and amenities. Users may feel lost or confused
                        about where to find relevant information and resources to facilitate their transition.
